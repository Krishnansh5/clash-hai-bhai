# Clash-Hai-Bhai
## Description
<i>clash hai bhai</i> is a tool enabling students from IIT Kanpur to design their academic template efficiently by automatically navigating through 500+ courses across 20+ departments that do not clash with the user's existing course template.

## Motivation

While I was planning my academic template during 2022 summers, I found it to be very <i>tedious & time-consuming</i> to look up my template & the courses I could take up. Since I wanted to make full use of the academic flexibility at IITK & explore all the options at hand, I decided to develop this tool which would automate this process.
